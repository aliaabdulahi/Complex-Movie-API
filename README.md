# Complex-Movie-API
The complex movie Api uses data retrieved from the move API and sends that data to the wikipedia API.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
An application where the user can lookup any movie using the Movie API and that will return the movies poster and the Directors name, When that information is retrieved the wikipedia api recieves the directors name and shows a brief description about the person

## Lessons Learned:
I learned how to make a complex api, meaning I had to learn how to use data retrieved from one api and send it as a parameter to another api.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:

**Kanye-west-app:** https://github.com/aliaabdulahi/Kanye-ExFans-Express
